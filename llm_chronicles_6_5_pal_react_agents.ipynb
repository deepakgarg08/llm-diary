        "At first, the different terminologies and implementations of **LLM agents** can seem confusing. Terms like **actions**, **tools**, **plugins**, and **functions** are often used interchangeably, adding to the complexity. However, at the core, the **ReAct framework** provides a flexible skeleton that allows users to customize how prompts, actions, and observations are handled.\n",

        "![picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyuz0/llm-chronicles/main/6.5%20-%20Lab%20-%20ReactAgents/react-formats.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic ReAct structure can be adapted to different formats:\n",
        "- **Actions** can be called using formats like **JSON** or **XML**.\n",
        "- **Observations** and outputs can be processed in a variety of ways depending on the task or model requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, we’ll showcase an example using an **XML-based prompt**, which is particularly well-suited for models like **Claude**. However, many modern models are flexible with prompt formats and can adapt to different structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some models, like **InternLM** ([InternLM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17297)), have been fine-tuned with specific syntaxes for **action/tool invocations**. In these cases, the model doesn't require in-context learning to interpret the prompt—it already \"knows\" how to handle the format, making the process more streamlined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, modern LLMs tend to be highly versatile and can handle a variety of syntaxes for **ReAct** and **tool calling**. Whether using JSON, XML, or another structure, the underlying principles of ReAct remain the same.\n"
